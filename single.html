          <p>To establish whether hacking can be considered ethical we must consider the original meaning of the term ‘hacking’. Hacking originated from the MIT (Massachusetts Institute of technology) railroad club. At the time hacking was considered a creative outlet that students used to modify and innovate their existing technology to create new functionality. Hacks were largely seen as a hobbyist adventure that included understanding, in depth the mechanics of a technology.
 </p>
            Hacker  “A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary” (Raymond, E 1996)
            <p>
            “When you grow up with an insatiable curiosity as to how things work, the delight you find upon discovering something as elegant as circuit logic, where all connections have to complete their loops, is profoundly thrilling” (Levy, S 1996)
            <p>
            Since its creation the term hacking has evolved to encompass a wider, more malicious meaning to the public. The portrayal of hackers in film and media combined with infamous high profile cases in which hackers have illegally exploited large websites to steal sensitive information have dramatically influenced how hacking is viewed and is the reason that the ethics of hacking is highly disputed.
